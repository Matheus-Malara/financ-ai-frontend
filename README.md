# FinancAI Frontend

A clean and fast React interface for **FinancAI** — an AI-powered stock analysis tool.  
Built for learning modern frontend development using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS.

---

## 📌 Description

This frontend allows users to enter a U.S. stock ticker (e.g. `WOLF`) and receive:
- A visual breakdown of fundamental financial indicators
- A summary and conclusion generated by OpenAI based on the data

The frontend communicates with a Spring Boot backend that handles data fetching and AI integration.
